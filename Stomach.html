<h3>How does it occur?</h3>
<p> When stomach acid backs up into your esophagus — a condition called acid reflux — you may feel a burning pain in the middle of your chest.While it’s common for people to experience acid reflux and heartburn once in a while, having symptoms that affect your daily life or occur at least twice each week could be a sign of GERD, a chronic digestive disease that affects 20 percent of Americans
Indigestion and heartburn are common problems. You can relieve some stomach problems with over-the-counter medicines and lifestyle changes, such as avoiding fatty foods or eating more slowly. Other problems like peptic ulcers or GERD require medical attention.</p>


<h3>Prevention</h3>
<p>Cutting back on fatty foods,avoiding fizzy drinks,eat and drink slowly,quit smoking, don't chew gum,exercising more,avoiding foods that cause gas and avoiding sweeteners that cause gas such as fructose and sorbitol.Avoid foods that trigger heartburn or reflux. For some, dairy causes the worst stomach problems.

<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Most people find relief by avoiding the foods and beverages that trigger their symptoms and/or taking over-the-counter antacids or other medication that reduces stomach acid production and inflammation of the esophagus. In addition, lifestyle changes like elevating the head of the bed, not lying down after a meal, avoiding tight-fitting clothing, and quitting smoking can also help. However, some cases of GERD require stronger treatment, such as medication or surgery. </p>
