<h3>How does it occur?</h3>
<p> A bacterial infection is a proliferation of a harmful strain of bacteria on or inside the body. Bacteria can infect any area of the body. Pneumonia, meningitis, and food poisoning are just a few illnesses that may be caused by harmful bacteria.
Bacterial infections can affect the throat, the lungs, the skin, the bowel and many others parts of the body. Many are mild, some are severe. Treatment is usually a course of antibiotics (which donâ€™t work against viruses).
Bacterial infections can be highly contagious and so you need to take special care to avoid spreading infections by washing hands, covering up when sneezing and coughing, and not sharing cups and drink bottles.</p>


<h3>Prevention</h3>
<p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Serious infections can be treated with antibiotics, which work by disrupting the bacterium's metabolic processes, although antibiotic-resistant strains are starting to emerge. Immunisation is available to prevent many important bacterial diseases such as Hemophilus influenza Type b (Hib), tetanus and whooping cough. For some viral diseases, such as herpes simplex virus infections, HIV/AIDS, and influenza, antiviral medications have become available, but drug-resistant microbes have been created as a result. </p>
